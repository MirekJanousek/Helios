XXX HACK

You have to carefully place liblua.dll here to use the vscode lua 
debugger extension.

This is a gruesome hack that may break things.  It needs to be a copy
of the lua51.dll file from the runtime of LUA 5.1 in the vscode lua-debug 
extension.  It is placed here so that socket/core.dll will link to it instead
of its liblua.dll, to enable the use of luasocket in the LUA debugger.

This hack will be removed when a better solution is found.
